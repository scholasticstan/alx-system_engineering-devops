What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser? 

Introduction:
When we enter a URL like "https://www.google.com" into our web browser and press Enter, it initiates a series of behind-the-scenes processes that bring us the desired web page. This seamless experience involves various components working together, such as DNS requests, TCP/IP, firewalls, HTTPS/SSL, load balancers, web servers, application servers, and databases. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at each step of this fascinating journey.

DNS Request:
The journey begins with a Domain Name System (DNS) request. When we type "https://www.google.com," our browser first contacts a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address. The DNS server returns the IP address associated with the domain, allowing our browser to know where to send the request.

TCP/IP:
With the IP address in hand, the browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection to the server. TCP breaks the data into small packets and ensures reliable communication between our computer and the server. It manages the transmission, acknowledgement, and retransmission of packets to guarantee data integrity.

Firewall:
Once the TCP connection is established, the request passes through firewalls. Firewalls act as a security barrier and filter incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. They protect against unauthorized access, malware, and other potential threats.

HTTPS/SSL:
To ensure secure communication between the browser and the server, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) protocol is used. HTTPS encrypts the data exchanged, preventing eavesdropping and tampering. It relies on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols to establish an encrypted connection.

Load-Balancer:
For popular websites like Google, multiple servers are often employed to handle the heavy traffic. A load balancer sits between the client and the server cluster, distributing incoming requests across multiple servers. It ensures optimal utilization of resources, improves scalability, and enhances the website's availability.

Web Server:
Once the request passes through the load balancer, it reaches the web server responsible for serving the requested web page. The web server retrieves the appropriate files and content and sends them back to the browser through the established TCP connection. Popular web servers include Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and Microsoft IIS.

Application Server:
In some cases, the web server alone is not sufficient to generate the requested web page. Dynamic websites, which generate content on the fly, often rely on application servers. The application server executes server-side scripts or applications, interacts with databases, and generates the content dynamically. Examples of application servers are Apache Tomcat, JBoss, and Microsoft IIS.

Database:
Many websites require data retrieval or storage from a database. The application server interacts with the database server to fetch or store the required information. Databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Oracle, provide a structured storage mechanism and efficient data retrieval capabilities.

Conclusion:
The journey from typing "https://www.google.com" to seeing the web page involves a complex orchestration of multiple components. The DNS request resolves the domain name, TCP/IP ensures reliable data transmission, firewalls safeguard against threats, HTTPS/SSL provides secure communication, load balancers distribute the load, web servers serve static content, application servers handle dynamic content generation, and databases store and retrieve data.
