**Postmortem: Web Stack Outage Incident**

**Issue Summary:**
Outage Duration: August 10, 2023, 09:30 AM - 10:45 AM (UTC)
Impact: The user authentication service experienced downtime, affecting 15% of users. Users were unable to log in, leading to disruptions in accessing key features.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer that was distributing traffic unevenly, causing increased load on one of the authentication servers.

**Timeline:**

- **09:30 AM:** The issue was detected when the monitoring system generated alerts for increased response times on the authentication service.
- **09:35 AM:** The engineering team was alerted to the issue and initiated an investigation.
- **09:40 AM:** Initial assumption was that a database query performance degradation might be causing the delays. DBAs were notified for assistance.
- **09:50 AM:** Database performance analysis indicated no significant issues. Focus shifted to network-related problems.
- **10:00 AM:** Load balancer configurations were reviewed, revealing a misconfiguration in the distribution algorithm.
- **10:15 AM:** Misleadingly, the team suspected a DDoS attack due to the uneven traffic distribution.
- **10:30 AM:** Incident was escalated to the senior engineering team and the DevOps team.
- **10:45 AM:** The issue was resolved by correcting the load balancer configuration.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**
The misconfigured load balancer was directing an imbalanced amount of traffic to a single authentication server, causing it to become overwhelmed. This resulted in delayed responses and authentication failures. The issue was fixed by adjusting the load balancer configuration to distribute traffic evenly across all available servers. Load balancer algorithms were also reviewed to prevent similar misconfigurations.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

1. **Configuration Auditing:** Implement regular reviews of critical system configurations to catch misconfigurations early.
2. **Load Testing:** Conduct load testing to ensure the load balancer behaves as expected under different traffic scenarios.
3. **Monitoring Enhancements:** Improve monitoring alerts for abnormal traffic patterns and load imbalances.
4. **Automated Scaling:** Implement automatic scaling of authentication servers to handle increased load without manual intervention.
5. **Incident Review:** Conduct a post-incident review to analyze the decision-making process and identify areas for improvement.

**Tasks to Address the Issue:**

1. **Load Balancer Configuration Audit:** Review all load balancer configurations to ensure they align with best practices.
2. **Load Testing Script:** Develop a comprehensive load testing script to simulate varying traffic loads and distribution patterns.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring Alerts:** Create customized alerts for traffic imbalances and deviations from expected load distribution.
4. **Auto-Scaling Implementation:** Integrate auto-scaling mechanisms into the authentication server infrastructure.
5. **Post-Incident Review:** Schedule a meeting to review the incident, identifying lessons learned and action items for future incidents.
